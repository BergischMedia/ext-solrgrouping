#Result Grouping

Result Grouping allows grouping of documents sharing a common field.
For each group the most relevant documents are returned.

An example is a search in an online store for a common term such as DVD, showing the top 3 results for each category ("TVs & Video", "Movies", "Computers", etc).

The most common use case is to group results by their type, like news, products, images, ... Each group's results are sorted by relevance.

You can configure the sorting criterion within a group.
